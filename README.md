# predictingProteinLocation
Taking a publically available dataset, we do an in-depth analysis, preprocessing and train models through supervised and unsupervised Machine learning methods. 
An instance in the dataset is a single protein, labeled with its location in a yeast cell. Attributes are numerical and represent various tests' results that describe some aspect about the protein.
I analyse the data, make the appropriate preprocessing steps, build various models(Decision trees, Naive Bayes, Distance based methods(Nearest neighbours), Decision rules), do clustering, draw conclustions and make some recommendations about the best actions to take.
